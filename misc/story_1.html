<p>ACH 101 - 01</p>
<p>Edward Tsang</p>

<p class="indented">	To think about 4 years from now, from when I graduate (or have graduated, as I will delve deeper into later) from Stony Brook, is almost impossible for me as I have not even attended my own High School graduation yet. My academic journey filled with strife and stress began early in high school, Stuyvesant High School, the "top school on the East Coast, or even the nation", where every Chinese parent urged their child to apply to, but not mine.</p>

<p class="indented">I always pushed myself, my parents weren't your typical immigrants. They had both gone to NYU for their masters in Computer Science, they became accustomed to western culture rather quickly and my friends sometime note how westernized my parents are compared to theirs. They never forced me to go down the same path of them and start a legacy, it was just mere coincidence that my passion lied in Computer Science as well. The Hunter College High School test, also another prestigious entrance exam, I remember that my parents brought it up, and I immediately asked for Saturday classes, for more prep exams, and when I was rejected in phase 2, I was disappointed in my own ability. My parents would always say you tried your best and that's all that matters, but those weren't my personal goals. </p>

<p class="indented"> Many people say they have their own personal goals. To make friends, to attain a 4.0 GPA, to understand a culture, but is it truly their own personal goal? That yearning for a 4.0 GPA, is the student a perfectionist, or rather is it for the parents? I never got that feeling for I was never pushed, and thus I learned to push myself. I wouldn't settle for anything below the best, I would take physics as a Freshman, go above and beyond in the Intro to CS classes at Stuyvesant, and then take AP Calculus BC as well as Pre-Calc at the same time in my junior year. I didn't care about AP credit for those were distractions. I wanted to learn, I wanted to push myself, I wanted to see how far I could push my limits. The education was free, so why waste time on trying to attain credit for something I do not find pleasure in, when I can go above and beyond. To take post-AP level courses in Computer Science and in Mathematics, to understand multivariate calculus, the little niches in different computer languages that I would have never learned in a high school setting. My academic success was pushing myself to the limit and succeeding, and that was my ultimate downfall. </p>

<p class="indented">	From three hours of sleep a night to sometimes even just 30 minutes, those were my days at Stuyvesant. My health took a turn for the worst, and I already had a rather weak immune system. My mental state would suddenly shatter, about a year ago from now. A mental breakdown is one of the worst experiences I've ever had, and every time I have one, it is as if I'm watching myself break down while being fully conscious. One moment, I'm a self-driven teenager studying for a calculus exam. The next, I'm on the floor writhing in pain, the headaches have overcome my mental stamina and I have no choice but to release. I am a five year old again, where crying fixes problems. But deep down, I know I'm sixteen, I know that calculus test still exists, and I know that I have to persevere. Getting to those classes were no longer an academic goal/success, they were personal now. To achieve them, it showed that I was strong, that I could take on any challenge face on and succeed, I wanted to be one of the best and as my IQ was not as high as some of my peers, I knew I would have to put in the work. I needed to prove to myself that I wasn't a failure, that I was worth something, but I couldn't, and that's what I foresee as the biggest challenge along the way. Just the night before the first day of class, I was sick with the cold, a recent skit done during orientation had brought back memories of my depression. I relapsed, alone at 2am, but only a week ago I would have been home with only High School to worry about. </p>

<p class="indented">You might ask, how does this segment of my high school life expand upon graduating in college, and to that I answer college didn't start for me a couple hours ago, it started for me in 2013, the school that people say is "the Harvard before Harvard". The only rewards I wish to receive from this journey is to be able to live again, for many of my teachers at my second high school noticed that I didn't know how to enjoy life anymore, that Stuyvesant had traumatized me. We joked, saying how giving me and assignment to find something fun to do would be the best way to find it, and yet it actually was. I was programmed to do assignments, I would worry about not completing them, I worried about not finding out how to have fun. I worry about being a failure again, that even though I pushed myself to go to college early, that maybe I might end up crashing again, that I might not end up making it, that this was a mistake. Failure haunts me every day, and it becomes to much to bear at times. It is why I reached out to DSS for a single dorm in Roosevelt, so I could vent out these feelings at times. It is why instead of requesting a new laptop for college, I just asked for a keyboard, because playing the piano always soothed me. I almost dialed CAPs last night, but my mother's words were reassuring, even if I had called her at an ungodly hour. She talked about how I was different, that I may be a STEM major, but I am well-rounded, that I shouldn't have anything to worry about. She told me that I came from Stuyvesant, where hell was the only reality I knew for three years. She told me that I was extremely proactive for a person of my age, as I did most of the college process myself, including sending in all the required paperwork and all the necessary phone-calls. </p>

<p class="indented">Yet, ironically, while it did soothe me, those words never registered on my brain. Once I am fixated on a task, nothing else matters. I do not care about my past achievements, I do not even see them as achievements, I see them as me taking the necessary actions required, nothing special. If everything I did seemed special, it would ruin things for me. I live for the thrill, and even though it may come with the anxiety, the depression, the fear of failing, is it the thrill that after I get through everything that I live for. </p>

<p class="indented">To why I say I may not even graduate within four years from now, and to that I say that it's because I don't want to be behind ever again. Starting in the spring means I'm either ahead of my fellow class of 2017 peers, or behind my 2016 peers, and while the former comes with its bragging rights, with its sense of accomplishments, only the latter registers in my brain. I <i> cannot </i> be behind anymore. I <i> cannot </i> fail again. I <i> will </i> take a summer semester. I <i> will </i> get out of Area of Interest and into the proper major. I <i> will </i> prove that I have done calculus and college level programming already, and I <i> will </i> graduate in three and a half years, with my fellows from the class of 2016. That is my ultimate goal, to regain the confidence I had myself within me in a time I can no longer remember. </p>
